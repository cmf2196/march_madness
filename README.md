# March Madness Prediction
Authors: Connor Finn, Riley Greene <dir>
Date: January, 2020

### Project Overview

This is an extension to a class [project](https://github.com/cmf2196/division1Basketball) we completed for our Columbia University course: Data Science for Mechanical Systems. A dataset was found which provides results from the ncaa tournaments in past years. We would like to use this, along with season long statistics for the included teams to build a predictive model for this year's tournament. The workflow includes three parts: <dir>
  * Scrape statistics for the teams who competed in the past ten NCAA tournaments.
  * Train a model using multiple machine learning methods
  * Use the built model to make predictions for this year's tournament (when available).
